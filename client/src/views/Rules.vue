    <h3>Submissions</h3>
    <p>Be responsible, anyone is allowed to submit someone elses run, if you're caught cheating, you will be banned.</p>
    <p>If you accidently submitted incorrect information for your run, resubmit it.</p>

    <p>This site accepts speedruns for all Capcom-official Hunt (Slay / Capture) or Slay quests where the target is one or more large monsters. Runs are divided into two main rulesets - TA Wiki Rules and Freestyle. Individual run categories are divided by quest, weapon, platform, and ruleset. Only top 3 runs in a category will be accepted, and Freestyle runs must be faster than the fastest TA Wiki run.</p>
    <h3>Freestyle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Runs must be shown in their entirety, from the "Begin Quest" screen to the "Main objective complete!" screen.</li>
      <li>Show damage numbers.</li>
      <li>Show gear, skills, and food skills, preferably during the quest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>TA Wiki Rules</h3>
    <p>TA Wiki Rules will not be decided until after game release.</p>
